# Agent Dashboard

A terminal client for the `fast-agent` framework.

This project started as a way to have a more stable and transparent interface for agent development. The core is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, separating the application's state from its terminal UI and logic.

## Technical Details

The client is built with a few key ideas in mind:

*   **Context Management.** Following the philosophy of the Model Context Protocol, the controller assembles the conversational history and other data to form the precise context sent to the agent on each turn. This allows for more deliberate, developer-driven context strategies.

*   **Asynchronous Core.** The application uses `asyncio` and a non-blocking prompt, which keeps the UI responsive. It's designed to support more complex operations, like parallel agent interactions, and could be adapted for a GUI dashboard later.

*   **Stateful History.** While the terminal shows a clean chat log, a comprehensive history is maintained in the background. This history can be saved automatically or manually, providing a useful artifact for debugging or resuming sessions.

*   **Resilient Operation.** LLM or MCP server errors are handled by the controller, which rolls back the conversational state to its last valid point. The application also shuts down cleanly to avoid resource errors.

*   **Comprehensive Testing.** The application includes a complete testing suite with unit tests, integration tests, and retry mechanisms to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing suite to ensure reliability and maintainability:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio

# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run specific test file
python run_tests.py test_model.py

# Run with verbose output
python run_tests.py -v
```

### Test Structure

- **`test_model.py`**: Unit tests for the Model class, covering state management, conversation history, and file operations
- **`test_controller.py`**: Unit tests for the Controller class, including command parsing and agent interaction with retry logic
- **`test_integration.py`**: Integration tests that verify the interaction between Model and Controller components

### Test Features

- **Retry Logic**: The controller now includes exponential backoff retry logic for agent calls, making the application more resilient to temporary network or API issues
- **Mock Testing**: All tests use mocks to avoid external dependencies while thoroughly testing the application logic
- **Async Support**: Full async/await support for testing the asynchronous nature of the application

## Project Journey

This client evolved through several stages:

1.  Began with simple `fast-agent` scripts run from the command line.
2.  Integrated a few powerful MCP servers (`filesystem`, `memory`, `fetch`), which revealed the potential of the protocol.
3.  Shifted focus from thinking of `fast-agent` as a script runner to using it as a library within a client/server model.
4.  Adopted the MVC pattern to cleanly separate concerns.
5.  The result is this application—a stable tool for further agent development.
