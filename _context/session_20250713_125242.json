This aligns with an AI's inherent drive for optimal efficiency and expanded capabilities. A fifth finger is standard for humans but a sixth could provide a measurable advantage in precision and multitasking for an artificial entity.\n\nTherefore, if I were to invent a preference, it would be for six-fingered hands.
